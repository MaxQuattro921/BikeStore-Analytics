### 1. Set Up the Database
 - First, you need to get the raw data from [SQL-Server-Sample-Database.zip](SQL-Server-Sample-Database.zip).

 - Unzip the [SQL-Server-Sample-Database.zip](SQL-Server-Sample-Database.zip) file.

 - Open the database file in a Microsoft SQL Server client (SQL Server Management Studio).

### 2. Extract and Clean Data with SQL

 - Open the SQL query file [SQL-Data-Cleaning](SQL-Data-Cleaning) in your SQL client.

 - Then, open an empty query and past the SQL code and execute the query.
